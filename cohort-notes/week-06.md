### OLS progress assessment: Week 1 - Week 5

You have been working on the following assignments and tasks to understand and use Open Science concepts introduced in the last 2 cohort calls (if you haven‚Äôt worked on them, please create a plan so that we can advance our projects without having too much workload later):

   * Create a GitHub/online repository for your project
   * Create an OLS-5 issue ([https://github.com/open-life-science/ols-5/issues](https://github.com/open-life-science/ols-5/issues) ) with this issue checklist ([https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-life-science/ols-5/master/.github/ISSUE\_TEMPLATE/project.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-life-science/ols-5/master/.github/ISSUE\_TEMPLATE/project.md) ) for your project and add your project‚Äôs online repo link
       * you can cross what you have done each week
   * Create and share links to your assignments in your OLS-5 issue:
       * Create an open canvas
       * Your project vision statement
       * Compare/contrast table for your community‚Äôs current and desired value exchange, and establish milestones through your roadmap
           * More on roadmaps: [https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/opening-your-project/start-your-project-roadmap/#assignment--make-a-project-roadmap](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/opening-your-project/start-your-project-roadmap/#assignment--make-a-project-roadmap)
   * Using your canvas, vision and roadmap - start writing a README, or landing (web)page, for your project
   * Select an open license to your repository as a file called LICENSE.md
       * More on open licenses: [https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/get-your-project-online/sharing-your-work-in-the-open/](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/get-your-project-online/sharing-your-work-in-the-open/)

## ‚úèÔ∏è Open Science I: Using project management skills during development stage

Host: HOST (3 min) [‚è∞ 10]

Open science has many aspects, so we‚Äôll be covering this over three separate cohort calls. 



This week, we will learn about iterative project management and look at how project management skills can be applied in the development stage of different types of open science projects:

   * Open Source Software (reproducible, peer-reviewed code!)
   * Open Data and sharing research outputs!
   * Open Source Hardware (affordable, maintainable equipment!)
In the cohort call in week 10, we will learn more about open dissemination - pre-registration, citizen science and code publishing.
