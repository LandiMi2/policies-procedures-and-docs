Notes

   *  Set an inclusive tone
       * Have a Code of Conduct - should be complete, specific for the community/team, actionable
       * Do an onboarding session with each new person
       *  Make yourselve available - ensure that people know that they can come to you for questions/concerns
           * If you're not sure if you can commit the time - consider setting a dedicated office hours for folks to talk to you
   * Make sure everyone knows where everything is
       * One main place is the best
       * have everyone contribute to the resources and documentation - also help folks feel ownership over the project
       * Double up on access- make sure not only one person have all the logins and access info
   * Make sure everyone know how decisions get made
       * Share your org chart so that folks have an understanding of when a decision gets made, where it's coming from
       * give people meaningful titles - helpful for acclimating people and also make people feel like part of the project/team
       * Share your deadlines - in advance, with everyone; less surprises and more ownership will help people contribute in a good, meaningful way
   * Make mistakes OK
       * Everyone makes mistakes! As much as you can, model making mistakes
       * When people make mistakes, help them learn
       * Terrified people are going to hide their mistakes
   * Celebrate - with the whole team!
       * EVERYONE who is part of their success
       * include everyone in your public thanks
       * make your rounds for internal thanks - it could be a small gift, or list everyone's work + contributions in an email

    Terminology: [http://files.frameshiftconsulting.com/asw/handout.pdf](http://files.frameshiftconsulting.com/asw/handout.pdf)



   * Intro - what is an Ally, why is this role needed?
       * Definitions
           * Technical privilege: we are more likely to listen to people who "are technical" (white men?)
           * Privilege: unearned advantage that some people get but not everyone
           * Oppression: Systemic, pervasive inequality
           * Marginalized person: someone who does not have as much privilege
           * Ally: a member of a social group that enjoys some privilege that is working to end oppression and understand their own privilege
       * You can't just wear the badge, you need to do the acts
       * Power: ability to control circumstances
       * Intersectionality: Multiple systems of oppression can interact
       * When marginalised people speak up for themselves, they are judged worse than when priviledged people speak up for marginalised people
   * Scenario
   * This workshop is not certification, an apology, or a "get-out-of-jail-free card"
   * Basics:
       * Be short, simple, firm
       * Don't try to be funny
       * Play for the audience
       * Practice simple responses
       * Pick your battles
   * When you're trying to help one group, don't do so at the detriment of another
   * If you make a mistake: apologize, correct, and move on
       * Group 1 (spoken/written): Scenario 3
           * *On a professional mailing list you belong to, a semi-famous colleague who came out as trans a year ago starts a discussion. In the response thread, another person repeatedly mis-genders them by using incorrect pronouns*
           * Notes:
               *

               *

       * Group 2 (spoken/written): Scenario 2
       * *A colleague of yours says, "It's great to hire more people of color, but let's not lower the bar." Before you can reply, another colleague says, "Oh yes, we'll be careful not to lower the bar."*
           * Notes:
               *   
               *
