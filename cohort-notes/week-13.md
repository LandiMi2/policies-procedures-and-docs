## üë• Personal Ecology and Self Care

HOST (‚è∞ 20 min) 25

### Reflection exercise: silent note taking

**Directions:** Share 1-3 word-pairs to describe your most fulfilling day at work. Then share 3 word-pairs to describe your least fulfilling one. Then consider sharing a little story or explain a bit about your responses to the group. Instead of story, you can also share something else - like an image, quote, recipe, or song, that best reflects your thoughts.

*Maybe share a gif, song or a quote if you don‚Äôt want to share your word pairs?*

The big idea: identify the most fulfilling conditions under which you thrive - sustain them; identify the least fulfilling conditions that frustrate you - avoid them.



**Word pairs that describe your most fulfilling day at work**
