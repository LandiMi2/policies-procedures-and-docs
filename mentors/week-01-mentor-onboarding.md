## 30 second intros

HOST (10 mins) +15

Share name, affiliations, open science experience etc. as desired - 30 seconds / person!

- roll call order <3 

(Maybe useful for who's struggling with internet: video options -  the up arrow next to Stop video > Video settings > Enable stop incoming video feature) <3 very useful!

This will "hide" (just for you) the videos of others in the call, so you will receive less data (ideally, easier to manage for your connection)



## Successes and challenges of mentoring 

HOST (20 mins) +35


*Goals:*

   * Understand common successes and challenges in mentoring
   * Know how to celebrate successes and approach challenges in mentoring 


**Breakout group - discussion for 15 minutes**

*A bit of background of the Open Life Science program to help catalyse the discussion!*



**Prompts **for sharing the successes you‚Äôve experienced in mentorship in the past and the challenges you think you will face as a mentor for OLS. Please only share what you‚Äôre comfortable sharing and be as abstract or general as you‚Äôd like; no need to overshare identifying information about people.

   * What‚Äôs working? What mentoring pro-tips can you share with others? How are you acknowledging, documenting, and celebrating success with your mentee?
   * What‚Äôs especially challenging? Where do you feel like you need help this round?
   * What do your experiences have in common? What insights can you bring back to the group?
   * Are there helpful resources you might share with the group?
