Subject: [Action required]  Mid-cohort survey and the next check-in call!


Hey all!

We hope that you are doing well.

We have reached the middle of this cohort and this is time for us to touch base, check how you are doing and how we can support you for the rest of the program. You are welcome to connect with us on Slack or book in a few minutes to chat if any discussion regarding your role in OLS-5 will be helpful.

**Mid-cohort survey:** To help us assess the impact of the program so far, and allow us to improve it for you for the remaining term, please take this mid-term survey for mentors: LINK REMOVED. Your participation is mandatory, but it will only take a few minutes to complete. You can edit your response until 30 April 2022. Please let us know if you need more time to respond to this.

**Mid-cohort meeting:** To have a general discussion and exchange experiences with each other, we will host two mentor chat slots (the content of both the calls will be the same). Please come along if you can attend one of these meetings, especially if you haven’t mentored for OLS before OLS-5. . 

Sign up in [the notes](https://pad.sfconservancy.org/p/ols-5-week-10-mentor-check-in).

Date and time: (both calls are the same!)  

- Wed, 4th May, 09:00 London time https://arewemeetingyet.com/London/2022-05-04/09:00
- Thu, 5th May, 17:00 London time https://arewemeetingyet.com/London/2022-05-05/17:00

Feel free to reach out to us by emailing team@openlifesci.org, or invite us to your next mentor-mentee call.
