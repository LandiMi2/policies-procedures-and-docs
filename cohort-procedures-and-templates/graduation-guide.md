## Extension for anyone affected by the COVID situation (or life!)

- If you would like to schedule a separate graduation call for any reasons (like affected by COVID-19 situation in your family/country/community or a big life event at home/work/personal reasons that impacted your work and slowed down your OLS project), please contact the OLS team by emailing [team@openlifesci.org](mailto:team@openlifesci.org).

## Prompts for your presentation

**Here are a few questions to help you generate ideas and content for your graduation presentation. Your notes to these prompts can be used to write a speed blog or a final report.**

- Below we share some prompts/questions for your to summarize your OLS journey so far and the project you worked on during the entire period of OLS.
- You will be able to use these notes to prepare for a 5 minutes presentation for the OLS graduation, taking place in week 15, or whenever you are ready to graduate if you need an extension.

**What is a speed blog?**

- You can draft your notes as speedblog in your 'mentor-mentee notes' and share with the OLS team. We will post your speedblog on OLS website: openlifesci.org/posts
- See this post for guidance on speed blogging: https://software.ac.uk/speed-blogging-and-tips-writing-speed-blog-post
