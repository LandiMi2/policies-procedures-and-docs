# Subject: [OLS-5 week 5] Mentor call and optional GitHub training

---------------

Hey all!

## Last week: 

We had a cohort call (notes), with Mayya Sundukova co-hosting the call, and guest speakers Hao Ye on open licensing, Raniere Silva on READMEs, and D Sarah Stamps on contributing guidelines and codes of conduct. If you were unable to attend, please review the notes, and make sure to watch the recording on YouTube - it should be on our YouTube channel by the end of Monday 28 April. 
🎉 We also voted on a cohort name: OLS-5 is cohort “Hope” - in your language it might be  cohort “Asha”/”आशा“ (Hindi), “Hoffen”/”Hoffnung” (German), "Esperanza"/”ilusión” (Spanish), "Tikva" תִקוָה (Hebrew), “Speranza” (Italian), “надежда”/”Nadezhda” (Russian), “ITXAROPENA” (Basque), “Hopen (Dutch), "희망"/”Hui-mang” (Korean), “希望”/”Hei Mong” (Chinese/Cantonese) and “Espoir” (French) (did we miss your language? Let us know in Slack).

## Next week - Everyone:

Meet with your mentor! Spend a few minutes chatting with your mentors about inviting an expert to a mentor meeting in week 7 or 9 to offer advice and insights - this could be someone from the OLS expert list or someone you or your mentor knows.

## Next week - Optional:

Monday 28th GitHub Training: We have an optional GitHub training cohort call. Come along if you are new to GitHub, if you’d like to learn about social and collaborative aspects of GitHub, or if you’d like to share your expertise with others! As usual, we will record the call for those who can’t make it.
