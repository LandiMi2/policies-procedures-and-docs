Subject: [OLS-5 week 11] Meet your mentors, meet the cohort, and open office
---------------

Dear [Hopen](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hopen#Dutch) Cohort!

## Last week:
We had a cohort call on open science and knowledge dissemination, with talks on persistent identifiers and discoverability (Joy Owango, TCC, Kenya), open access and preprints (Alex Mendonça, SciELO, Brazil), and open training in low and middle income settings (Piv Gopalasingam, EBI, UK). The recording will be available soon on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/OpenLifeSci), and you can also see our shared notes.

## This week - Everyone:
Three things! 

1️⃣ Social assignment: Some of you mentioned in your mid-cohort surveys that you’d like more chances to meet others from the cohort. This week, your assignment is to reach out to one other OLS-5 cohort member and arrange to meet and chat for half an hour via video, voice call, or Slack chat. You can reach out to other groups using your [GitHub issues](https://github.com/open-life-science/ols-5/), Slack, or come join us at the Q&A call to find someone. 

2️⃣ Meet your mentor! A small challenge: If you or one of your team-mates (if you have a team) haven’t chaired a mentor meeting yet, we invite you to do so this week. Spend a little while chatting and admiring how far you’ve come, and think about what you’ll do with the remaining time in the program 🌸

3️⃣ 👉👉👉 Mid-term Survey: If you haven’t done so already, we’d really appreciate your feedback in this mid-term survey: [ADD LINK]
It should only take a minute or two.

## This week - Optional:

Open Q&A call:  If you missed the cohort call last week and would like to discuss any of the concepts from the video and notes, come along to the open Q&A call (30 minutes):
