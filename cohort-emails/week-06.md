Hello Cohort Esperanza!

## Next week: 

We will have our Open Science I: Project Development cohort call, with several experienced guest speakers. We will discuss agile project development/management plans (Renato Alves) and introduce different practices in open-source hardware (Hong Phuc Dang), open-source software (Andrew Stewart), and open data (Lilly Winfree).

## This week:

We hope that you had a great time catching up with your mentors, discussing your assignments, and sharing your understanding of how the assignments apply to your community!
We also had a GitHub skill-up training call ([syllabus](https://openlifesci.org/ols-5/schedule#week-05), [notes](https://bit.ly/ols-5-week-05), and [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90BOler9hqI)) for folks who are new to GitHub. Please use Slack (#technical-help or #ols-5-general) to ask questions and receive help in troubleshooting.

Start getting ready to bring your project online in the next few weeks through GitHub, [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/), [Google Sites](https://sites.google.com/), or other suitable ways (if you haven’t done that already). If you need help with this, connect with us on Slack.
