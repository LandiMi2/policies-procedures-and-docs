Subject: [OLS-5 week 7] Mentor call and an optional Q&A call!
---------------

Dear cohort [‡§Ü‡§∂‡§æ / Asha](https://dict.hinkhoj.com/shabdkhoj.php?word=%E0%A4%86%E0%A4%B6%E0%A4%BE&ie=UTF-8),

This week:

We had a cohort call: ‚ÄúOpen Science I: Project Development and Introduction to Working Open‚Äù. Guest speakers Renato Alves, Andrew Stuart, Lilly Winfree and Hong Phuc Dang shared their experience in applying iterative project management methods, and managing and developing open software, data and hardware. If you were unable to attend, the recording will be on YouTube by end of day Monday 11 April. In the meantime you can review the [notes](https://bit.ly/ols-5-week-06) (thank you Festus for co-hosting this call!)

To help you break down your project‚Äôs milestones using agile development and management methods, [we have an assignment for you](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FFU3ZngDl_Rh1V979qvnKMQSgyAZ0VnvPhCBcu7CSL8/edit?usp=sharing) (make a copy for your project). 

Next week - everyone: Meet with your mentor! 
You should invite an expert to this week‚Äôs call and/or prepare to invite another one for week 9. If you are not sure who to invite, please contact us (team@openlifesci.org) so that we can help you identify one from the OLS expert list or someone we may know in our network. 

Prepare to meet an expert: We have a guide to help you prepare notes that you should share with the invited expert in your invitation email. This will allow the experts to assess what to expect at the call and how best they can share their skills and insights with you: https://github.com/open-life-science/policies-procedures-and-docs/blob/main/cohort-procedures-and-templates/expert-guide.md 

Next week - optional: Open Q&A call
We‚Äôre now almost in the 7th week of the program! We have discussed many topics and open science concepts and imagine that you have many questions, and ideas that you might want to discuss. Come along to our open Q&A call to share those with the OLS team:
