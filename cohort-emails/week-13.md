Hello Hope Cohort!


Last week:

Last week we had a cohort call on Diversity and Inclusion along with the skill-up session on ally skills. This is an important aspect of Open Science that we want to promote in your projects and communities (Notes: https://bit.ly/ols-5-week-12). Please catch up by watching it on our YouTube channel along with any other cohort calls you might have missed: https://www.youtube.com/c/OpenLifeSci.

Next week: 

At this week’s special call, we will host a short skill up session (20 minutes) on personal ecology and self care as open leaders which will be followed by a social session. We will try out Remotely Green, a sort of “Speed dating” or automatic breakout room tool, which you can preview here: https://app.remotely.green/event/f28c405f2701413bbb6ca1c2a87b523 

The social call is open to all OLS members, previous and current cohorts!

Mentor meeting next week: 

We’re heading towards the end of the program. During your catch up with your mentor this week, please take some time to reflect on what you’ve learned and achieved in OLS so far, as well as what you’d like to share at the graduations in June. 

Assignments:

    Catch up on your past assignments if you missed out on them. If you haven’t arranged to meet an OLS expert yet, please make sure to discuss it with your mentor or ask in slack for advice on who to invite - at least one expert invitation per project is required during OLS-5.

Upcoming graduations and OLS-5 call: 

Next week we’ll share registration forms for OLS-5 graduations, and we’re also exploring bi-lingual English/Spanish graduations for one of the sessions. More next week! 

As always, thank you for your continued engagement and hard work. We are so excited to see you all arriving at the end of the programme and can’t wait to celebrate your graduation.

Stay well!

Your Open Life Science Team,

Emmy, Malvika, Yo, Bérénice
