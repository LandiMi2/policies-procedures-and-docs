üìö Thinking about OLS-5 graduations

Every cohort of OLS wraps up with graduation calls: in week 15 we offer three time slots for graduation ‚Äúrehearsal‚Äù preparation calls, and three more time slots in week 16 for The Real Thing, live streamed to YouTube - or if you‚Äôd prefer to do it privately, that‚Äôs fine too! Check the dates out in the OLS Calendar, or subscribe to the OLS calendar in your calendar: https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=b3BlbmxpZmVzY2lAZ21haWwuY29t 

If you‚Äôve experienced a delay or impact of any kind, from COVID, kids, interruption in electricity, extremely busy work life‚Ä¶ or any other life events affecting the wellbeing of you, your family, or your friends - let us know (te...@openlifesci.org or a DM on Slack), and we‚Äôll put things on pause and arrange to wrap up graduations when things are a bit calmer. 

Stay well!

Your Open Life Science Team,

Malvika, Yo, B√©r√©nice, Emmy
