Hi all!

We're heading towards the end of OLS-5 and that means it's time to start planning for graduations! Here's what you need to know. 

We have five graduation slots coming up in June and July. In order to get an OLS-5 certificate, you must participate in a graduation. 
- Registration: https://www.eventbrite.com/cc/ols-5-graduations-432229 <-- PLEASE REGISTER FOR A SLOT ASAP SO WE CAN PLAN
- Time zones: https://pad.sfconservancy.org/p/ols-5-graduations 

If you **have been able to attend/watch calls** (cohort calls, mentoring calls, etc.) and complete some assignments: Please register for whichever graduation slot works best for you! 

If you **haven't attended/watched many calls** and/or are missing some assignments: Don't worry, you can still graduate! We are hosting several catch-up sessions over June and early July. Please come to at least two sessions (time/dates here: and in the OLS calendar https://pad.sfconservancy.org/p/ols-5-catchup-sessions ) and be prepared to work on (or discuss) assignments. These will be very loosely structured calls, giving you a chance to chat to OLS community members, including cohort members and OLS organisers, and catch up on OLS things in a low-pressure way. 

View all the session dates / times in the OLS calendar or this etherpad: https://pad.sfconservancy.org/p/ols-5-catchup-sessions Still can't attend? email te...@openlifesci.org or y...@openlifesci.org and we'll help out. 

**¿Habla español? (Speak Spanish?)** - if you can, please register for graduation 5. We're in the process of arranging two translators, one English -> Spanish, and one Español -> Ingles. English speakers are welcome to present at this call too, but priority will be given to Spanish speakers if needed. <-- PLEASE REGISTER ASAP SO WE CAN GIVE DETAILS TO OUR TRANSLATORS

We will have limited slots for the presenters at each call, therefore, please register as a presenter (choose the “Presenter (OLS-5 project leader” option) for one call only where you will share your work and graduate from the cohort. 

Would you like to invite anyone outside of OLS to join and watch your graduation? Please share the above registration page links with them - they can register (as viewers) to participate in the call(s). We’ll also invite all OLS-5 mentors and experts! 

If you’ve experienced a delay or impact of any kind, from COVID or any other life events affecting the wellbeing of you, your family, or your friends - let us know (te...@openlifesci.org or a DM on Slack), and we’ll put things on pause and arrange to wrap up graduations when things are a bit calmer. 

## What do I do at a graduation?! 
We have a grad guide - check it out here: https://github.com/open-life-science/policies-procedures-and-docs/blob/main/cohort-procedures-and-templates/graduation-guide.md - and you can admire previous graduations on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/OpenLifeSci/playlists - there are four graduation playlists from OLS-1 to OLS-4.
