Hello å¸Œæœ›/Hei Mong Cohort!
Can you believe we have reached the middle of the program? Neither can we! ðŸ¤¯
By now, you may have gotten your project up (online) and running. We want to remind you that the aim of this program is to help you learn best practices in Open Science and grow your community leadership skills through our cohort calls and assignments. Therefore, it's completely ok if you haven't found the direct applications of these practices or skills into your current project, or haven't completed some assignments yet. You should approach these lessons as a useful skill-set for the long term.

Next week - optional but hugely popular:

On Monday 25 April, we have a skill-up call on Open Leadership, where weâ€™ll be hosting a panel with community leaders who bring a wide range of expertise from academia, funding, policy development and social entrepreneurship - Angela Okune, Jason Williams, Mayya Sundukova, and Melissa MendonÃ§a.

This week - everyone: Meet with your mentor! 

You should invite an expert to this weekâ€™s call and/or prepare to invite another one for week 10. If you are not sure who to invite, please contact us (team@openlifesci.org) so that we can help you identify one from the OLS expert list or someone we may know in our network. 

Preparations for meeting with an expert: We have [a guide](https://github.com/open-life-science/policies-procedures-and-docs/blob/main/cohort-procedures-and-templates/expert-guide.md) to help you prepare notes that you should share with the invited expert in your invitation email. This will allow the experts to assess what to expect at the call and how best they can share their skills and insights with you.

Mid-term Survey

There is no assignment this week except for a short survey for you to fill out. To help us assess the impact of the program so far, and allow us to improve it for you for the remaining term, please take this mid-term survey: LINK REMOVED
This is mandatory, but should only take a minute or two. You can edit your response until April 30, 2022. 

Last week

We had a cohort call on community design for inclusivity, co-chaired by Batool! Chad Sansing, Anelda van der Walt and Yo talked about the mountain of engagement, using personas and pathways to build communities and mentored contributions.

A recording of the call will be uploaded to the OLS YouTube channel in the next few days. You can also check out our shared notes from the call. 

Questions, worries, concerns, ideas? Email team@openlifesci.org or book in a few minutes to chat ðŸ—£ (open equally to project leads/mentees/experts/mentors).

Your Open Life Science Team,
