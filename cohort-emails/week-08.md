## ðŸ“š Assignments so far
We hope you are making time to do your assignments in the context of your projects. Please update your issues (https://github.com/open-life-science/ols-5/issues) to ask for feedback, question or support as needed. We encourage you to also connect with others on our Slack workspace.
If youâ€™ve been having trouble keeping up with the assignments, don't worry. You can always go back and reflect upon the assignments in the next weeks or in the future - it may surprise you how often we refer back to these lessons! Please remember that the main goal here is to learn and understand the wider application of open science concepts.

## Before this cohort call:

- Create a project development plan for your project: Assignment to help you use Agile methods to break down your milestones into smaller tasks and define a timeline for your milestones.
- You can explore how to manage your tasks using project management or kanban tool like GitHub projects (short intro), Trello, Asana or Zenhub in GitHub
- Make sure that by now you have added a license, contribution guideline, and selected a Code of Conduct in your GitHub repository. If you feel stuck and donâ€™t know where you start, take a look at this repo to see a basic recommended structure of an open-source project.
- Look up two other projects and comment on their issues and share feedback on their Open Canvas and README

Feeling lost, need some more personal discussion, or want someone to listen to your ideas/plan/concerns, book in a few minutes to chat ðŸ—£ (open equally to project leads/mentees/experts/mentors).
